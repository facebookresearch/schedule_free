class RAdamScheduleFreeClosure(torch.optim.Optimizer):
    r"""
    Schedule-Free RAdam
    Neither warmup hyperparameter nor scheduler is needed with this optimizer.

    This "closure" version requires that step be called with a closure, see 
    https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html#optimizer-step-closure. 
    
    Arguments:
        params (iterable):
            Iterable of parameters to optimize or dicts defining
            parameter groups.
        lr (float):
            Learning rate parameter (default 0.0025)
        betas (Tuple[float, float], optional): coefficients used for computing
            running averages of gradient and its square (default: (0.9, 0.999)).
        eps (float):
            Term added to the denominator outside of the root operation to
            improve numerical stability. (default: 1e-8).
        weight_decay (float):
            Weight decay, i.e. a L2 penalty (default: 0).
        r (float): Use polynomial weighting in the average
            with power r (default 0).
        weight_lr_power (float): During warmup, the weights in the average will
            be equal to lr raised to this power. Set to 0 for no weighting
            (default 2.0).
        foreach (bool): Use a foreach-backed implementation of the optimizer.
            Should be significantly faster, but will have higher peak memory
            usage (default True if supported in your PyTorch version).
        silent_sgd_phase (bool): If True, the optimizer will not use the first SGD phase of RAdam.
            This means that the optimizer will not update model parameters during the early training
            steps (e.g., < 5 when Î²_2 = 0.999), but just update the momentum values of the optimizer.
            This helps stabilize training by ensuring smoother warmup behavior and more reliable
            calculation of the moving average coefficient (`ckp1`). Recommended to set to True
            (default True).
        cautious (bool, experimental): If True, applies a cautious update strategy as proposed in 
            https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16085 and implemented in https://github.com/kyleliang919/C-Optim. 
            While the original cautious optimizer aligns momentum updates with gradient directions
            for faster convergence, our implementation differs in its combination with Schedule-Free 
            optimization. Since the z-update in Schedule-Free doesn't contain momentum terms, directly 
            applying cautious mask to z-update is meaningless. Instead, we apply the cautious operations 
            to the y-update (after implicit x contraction), as y represents the training parameters 
            where cautious update is more appropriate. Our preliminary experiments suggest this adaptation 
            can lead to slightly faster convergence, though the theoretical implications of combining 
            these approaches remain to be fully understood (default: False).
